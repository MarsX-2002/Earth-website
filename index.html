After the conference the quantum mechanics community split into two camps: those who adhered to Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg’s position known as the Copenhagen Interpretation — which, among other things, describes what happens when an observer attempts to make a measurement—and those like Albert Einstein and Erwin Schrödinger who were not willing to accept that “pillow of complementarity.”</div>
